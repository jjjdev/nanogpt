## Overview
NanoGPT is a project that aims to build a lightweight language model (LLM) trained on a dataset that mimics Shakespeare's writing style. This project leverages deep learning techniques to generate text that resembles Shakespearean language.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training NanoGPT consists of a collection of Shakespeare's plays, sonnets, and other literary works. This dataset is preprocessed to extract the text and convert it into a format suitable for training a language model.

## Model Architecture
NanoGPT utilizes a transformer-based architecture, which has proven to be highly effective in natural language processing tasks. The transformer model consists of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks. This architecture allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and generate coherent text.

## Training Process
During the training process, NanoGPT learns to predict the next word in a sequence given the previous words. This is achieved through a process called language modeling. The model is trained using a variant of the popular transformer-based training algorithm, such as the Transformer-XL or GPT-2.

## Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the performance of NanoGPT, several metrics can be used, such as perplexity and BLEU score. Perplexity measures how well the model predicts the next word in a sequence, while BLEU score compares the generated text with reference text to assess its similarity.

## Results and Future Work
The trained NanoGPT model can generate text that closely resembles Shakespearean language. However, there is still room for improvement. Future work could involve fine-tuning the model on a larger and more diverse dataset, exploring different hyperparameters, or incorporating additional techniques such as reinforcement learning.

## Usage
To use NanoGPT, follow the instructions in the project's documentation. This may involve installing the required dependencies, downloading the pre-trained model, and running the provided scripts or APIs to generate text.
